# Morning Routine at NYUAD

## Project Description  
The "Morning Routine at NYUAD" project is an interactive web experience designed to help NYU Abu Dhabi students rediscover their mornings with purpose and confidence. The project focuses on overcoming monotony in daily routines, providing helpful tips for students to energize their mornings and maximize productivity. The overall concept emphasizes mindfulness, productivity, and self-care, while striving to create a community-centered experience.

## Process  
The implementation of the "Morning Routine at NYUAD" project involved several stages, including:  
1. **Research & Conceptualization**: We identified the needs and challenges that NYUAD students face in their daily routines, with a focus on monotony and lack of motivation.  
2. **Content Creation**: We curated various morning hacks and success stories from NYUAD alumni, as well as a video that encapsulates the typical morning struggles of a student.  
   (Note: The video was created collaboratively with two other students, while the development of the website was handled solely by me.)  
3. **Web Development**: The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started with HTML to structure the content, added CSS for styling, and implemented JavaScript for interactive elements, such as alumni card flips and user-submitted tips.  
4. **Testing & Feedback**: After the initial build, I conducted user testing with students to gather feedback on the user experience. Based on feedback, I iterated on the design to improve usability and engagement.

## Reflection/Evaluation  
The initial concept aimed to provide students with a practical, interactive resource to start their day on a positive note. The final working version met the expectations set out at the beginning of the project. The tips section proved to be highly useful for students, and the success stories of alumni were motivating. Additionally, the user-submitted tip feature created a sense of community and engagement, allowing others to contribute their insights. The project has successfully helped students rethink their morning routines and has potential for future updates, such as including more personal stories or integrating calendar-based morning planning.
