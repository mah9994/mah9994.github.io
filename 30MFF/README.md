# Morning Routine at NYUAD

## Project Name
**Morning Routine at NYUAD**

## Project Description  
The "Morning Routine at NYUAD" project is an interactive web experience created to help NYU Abu Dhabi students rediscover the power of their mornings. The concept centers around addressing the common struggles students face with their morning routines and offers practical tips and motivational stories to kick-start a productive day. The project encourages mindfulness, self-care, and well-being, while aiming to help students create a positive and intentional start to their day. The theme revolves around personal growth, productivity, and community, striving to make mornings more meaningful.

The project also includes success stories from NYUAD alumni, offering inspiration and real-life insights into how successful individuals begin their day. In addition to offering tips for students, the project includes an interactive feature where users can submit their own morning routines or hacks, fostering a sense of community engagement.

## Process  
The development of the "Morning Routine at NYUAD" project involved a comprehensive and collaborative approach that spanned across research, design, content creation, and web development. The process was structured as follows:

### 1. **Research & Conceptualization**  
The first step in the project was to identify the key challenges NYUAD students face in their morning routines. Through discussions and research, it became clear that many students experience a sense of monotony in their mornings, with some struggling to find motivation or establish a productive routine. We aimed to address these challenges by providing solutions that encouraged mindfulness, self-care, and small habit changes.  
During this phase, we also researched various resources, including tips on productivity, motivation, and morning wellness. Additionally, we sought success stories from NYUAD alumni to inspire and motivate current students, helping them see how others overcome similar challenges.

### 2. **Content Creation**  
With the concept in mind, the next phase involved curating content that would resonate with students.  
- **Morning Hacks**: A collection of practical tips was gathered to help students optimize their morning routines. These tips focused on small changes to their habits, such as how to wake up feeling energized, the benefits of meditation or stretching, and how to create a calming environment.
- **Success Stories**: I reached out to a few NYUAD alumni who shared their personal morning routines, providing valuable insights and inspiration for students.
- **Video Creation**: A video was created to visualize the typical morning struggles faced by students and to promote the concept of transforming one’s morning for a more productive and positive day. This video was shot in collaboration with two other students and served as an engaging introduction to the project. It set the tone for the rest of the site by depicting the challenges and potential solutions for students.

### 3. **Web Development**  
The next stage was the actual development of the website. The web development process was a step-by-step approach that included the following technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **HTML**: I began by structuring the content using HTML. This included creating the homepage, information pages, a tips section, and an alumni stories section. The content was divided into logical sections to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **CSS**: Once the HTML structure was in place, I moved on to styling the website using CSS. The design focused on simplicity and readability, with a clean layout that highlighted the content and made it easy for users to navigate. The colors and fonts were chosen to create a calming, welcoming atmosphere.
- **JavaScript**: The next step was to add interactivity to the website using JavaScript. I implemented features such as:
  - **Alumni Card Flips**: Users can interact with alumni cards to read their success stories and morning tips.
  - **User-submitted Tips**: A feature was added where students could submit their own morning routines or life hacks. This allowed students to feel more connected to the community, contributing their own insights.
  - **Interactive Tips Section**: Users can hover over various tips to reveal more detailed information or suggestions.

### 4. **Testing & Feedback**  
After the website was developed, I conducted testing with a small group of students to gather feedback on the user experience. This step was essential for identifying areas of improvement in usability, navigation, and content engagement.  
- **Usability Testing**: I asked students to use the website and navigate through different sections while providing feedback on ease of use, design, and content relevance.
- **Design Iteration**: Based on the feedback received, I made several adjustments to improve the website’s layout and interactivity. These changes included simplifying some elements, enhancing the visual appeal, and ensuring that the content was easily accessible.

### 5. **Final Adjustments and Launch**  
After implementing the changes, I tested the website again to ensure that it was functioning as expected across various devices and browsers. Once everything was finalized, the project was launched, and the website became available for the NYUAD community to access.

## Reflection/Evaluation  
The goal of the "Morning Routine at NYUAD" project was to provide a useful, interactive platform that would inspire and motivate students to rethink their morning routines. As the only developer of the website, I faced the challenge of creating a fully functional and visually appealing site on my own, while also ensuring that the content resonated with the target audience.

Upon completing the project, I found that the website met the initial goals set at the beginning:
- **Student Engagement**: The user-submitted tips feature was particularly successful, as students felt involved in the project by sharing their own morning routines and connecting with others.
- **Content Effectiveness**: The tips and success stories provided valuable resources for students to consider when improving their morning routines. The motivational aspect of the alumni stories was well-received and helped students feel more connected to their community.
- **User Experience**: The website was easy to navigate, and students appreciated the clean and calming design. The interactive elements such as the alumni card flips and the tips section kept users engaged.

Overall, the project achieved the goal of providing an engaging and supportive resource for students to create better morning routines. Looking ahead, there are opportunities for further improvements, such as integrating a personalized morning planner or adding a community forum where students can share their experiences in more detail. The project has the potential to expand with additional content and interactive features that could further enhance the student experience at NYUAD.
