    <h3>NYUAD Alumni and Their Stories</h3>
    
    <h5>Maryam Alshehhi</h5>
    <p><strong>Producing Work, Staying Healthy, and Developing New Habits</strong></p>
    <p>Maryam Alshehhi, a literature and creative writing and political science student, sought experiences that challenged her. After transferring to NYUAD, she embraced opportunities like an internship at TwoFour54, where she worked with Tent Pictures Productions.</p>
    <p>During her internship, she led the creation of a "making-of" book for the film <em>Cats Away</em>, which documents old Abu Dhabi through street cats. Through interviews and film analysis, she contributed to what could be one of the first such books in the UAE.</p>
    <p>Beyond work, she stepped out of her comfort zone by studying French, maintaining a daily gym routine, attending yoga classes, and exploring Abu Dhabi. Her structured approach helped her balance professional and personal growth.</p>
    
    <h5>Alia ElKattan</h5>
    <p><strong>From Self-Doubt to a Job at McKinsey</strong></p>
    <p>Alia ElKattan, Class of 2020, graduated with a degree in computer science and minors in political science, sound and music computing, and interactive media. Initially undecided, she explored various fields before settling on computer science.</p>
    <p>During her sophomore year, she secured an internship as a UX designer at McKinsey & Company, despite feeling unqualified. That experience later led to a full-time job as a Junior Digital Analyst.</p>
    <p>ElKattan’s advice to students is to trust the process. “There’s so much pressure to figure out what you want to do forever, but what really matters is finding something you enjoy.”</p>
