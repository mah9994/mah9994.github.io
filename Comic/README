3.Storyline
Beryllium (Be) struggles to bond with other elements and often feels isolated. In the classroom, she is bullied and envies Oxygen (O), who easily forms bonds with others. Despite Be’s resistance, Oxygen approaches her during lunchtime, offering friendship. Overwhelmed, Be runs away, rejecting the offer.
However, the next day, Be realizes her mistake and apologizes. They have an open conversation, where they express their emotions and learn that everyone has their own limitations—and that’s okay. Be learns to accept her worth and opens herself up to connection.

🔹 Moral of the story: We should embrace our individuality and be open to those around us.
